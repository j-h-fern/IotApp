            <h2>What is an IoT Application</h2>
            <p>
                Iot is the idea that by using the internet and its ability to transport data<br>
                we can interconnect smart sensing devices and systems with more powerful data<br>
                storage and manipulation systems. This network can be used then to remotely <br>
                operate and monitor these devices and systems. This gives massive real time <br>
                analytical capacity and allows for better efficiency and more control.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Smart House</h2>
            <p>
                A smart house main feature would be been capable of centrally controlling and <br>
                manipulating various smart systems with in a domestic situation. With the aim of<br>
                maximising the automation of these systems an the associated efficiency <br>
                and benefits.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>IoT Interface</h2>
            <p>
                Inter faces requierd in smart and IoT applications will be varied and unique <br>
                to each situation most will requier secure interfaces to avoid tampering and <br>
                others will have high levels of manual control.<br>
